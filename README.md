An incipient examination over origins of cloisters

When working with categories of things, we want to know where do thoe belong.

For example, we have the business traveler that stays at the best hotels, the coach that travels in their own van, the family that is only exploring the most modest B&B. These are all different segments, different tastes, and they all belong to a specific segment that we can tease out of the data that comes out of some sufficiently motivated traveling agency.

The Cloisters exploration is going to be about how data presents enough characteristics to give an indication of what segments are relevant to our epxloration. We can get these segments based oin what our goals are, what is shown at a given moment, and from the instrument that we used to collect the data: all instruments have an underlying bias, or a idiosincratic limitation that allow the researcher to explain a point, because that is relevant to what is being considered crucial to the business at hand.
